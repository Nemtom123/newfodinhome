# Getting support

## GitHub

You can report issues and feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5). This is also a good place to discuss architecture decisions and things which are not yet covered by the documentation.

[Each CKEditor 5 repository](https://github.com/ckeditor?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ckeditor5&type=&language=) handles its issues independently. If you are not sure where your ticket belongs, it is best to report it in the [main repository](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5).

Refer to {@link builds/guides/support/reporting-issues Reporting issues} guide for more details.

## Stack Overflow

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is the best place for developers to share their problems and solutions.

Make sure to tag your questions with ["ckeditor"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ckeditor) and ["ckeditor5"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ckeditor5) to reach the widest audience.

## Commercial support

CKEditor 5 also comes with commercial licensing benefits, such as direct support from the core CKEditor development team. Commercial licenses are designed with professionals and enterprises in mind.

For more information, check the [CKEditor 5 Pricing page](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5-builds/pricing/).
